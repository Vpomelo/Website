                <b>How to prepare your submissions</b>
            </li>

            <p>
                Algorithms and resources used in a paper should be described as completely as possible to allow reproducibility. This includes experimental methodology, empirical evaluations, and results. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available whenever possible. In addition, authors are strongly encouraged to also report, whenever possible, results for their methods on publicly available datasets.
            </p>

            <li>
                <b>Online Submission System</b>
            </li>
            <p>All manuscripts are submitted as full papers and are reviewed based on their scientific merit. The reviewing process is confidential. There is no separate abstract submission step. Manuscripts must be submitted electronically in <a href="https://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2022/icdm22/scripts/ws_submit.php?subarea=S">online submission system</a>. <b>We do not accept email submissions.</b></p>

            <p><b>Note that all accepted papers will be included in the IEEE ICDM 2022 Workshops Proceedings volume published by IEEE Computer Society Press, and will also be included in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. ​​Therefore, papers must not have been accepted for publication elsewhere or be under review for another workshop, conferences or journals.</b></p>
