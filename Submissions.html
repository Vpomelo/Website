            <li><b>Submission Guidelines</b></li>
            <p>
                Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages, including the bibliography and any possible appendices. Full paper submissions should be formatted according to the IEEE 2-column format(<a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">link</a>).
                Submissions longer than 10 pages will be rejected without review. All submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Program Committee based on technical quality, relevance to scope of the conference, originality, significance, and clarity.
                The following sections give further information for authors. Please refer to the ICDM regular submission requirment for more information:<a href="https://icdm22.cse.usf.edu/calls/Papers.html">https://icdm22.cse.usf.edu/calls/Papers.html/</a>
            </p>
            <li>
                <b>How to prepare your submissions</b>
            </li>
            <p>
                The authors shall omit their names from the submission. For formatting templates with author and institution information, simply replace all these information items in the template by “Anonymous”.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the submission, the authors should refer to their own prior work like the prior work of any other author, and include all relevant citations. This can be done either by referring to their prior work in the third person or referencing papers generically. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on clustering, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on distance-based clustering (Smith 2019),” you might say “We extend Smith’s earlier work (Smith 2019) on distance-based clustering.”
                The authors shall exclude citations to their own work which is not fundamental to understanding the paper, including prior versions (e.g., technical reports, unpublished internal documents) of the submitted paper. Hence, do not write: “In our previous work [3]” as it reveals that citation 3 is written by the current authors. The authors shall remove mention of funding sources, personal acknowledgments, and other such auxiliary information that could be related to their identities. These can be reinstituted in the camera-ready copy once the paper is accepted for publication. The authors shall make statements on well-known or unique systems that identify an author, as vague in respect to identifying the authors as possible. The submitted files should be named with care to ensure that author anonymity is not compromised by the file names. For example, do not name your submission “Smith.pdf”, instead give it a name that is descriptive of the title of your paper, such as “ANewApproachtoClustering.pdf” (or a shorter version of the same).
            </p>
            <p>
                Algorithms and resources used in a paper should be described as completely as possible to allow reproducibility. This includes experimental methodology, empirical evaluations, and results. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available whenever possible. In addition, authors are strongly encouraged to also report, whenever possible, results for their methods on publicly available datasets.
            </p>

                <b>Online Submission System</b>
            </li>
            <p>All manuscripts are submitted as full papers and are reviewed based on their scientific merit. The reviewing process is confidential. There is no separate abstract submission step. Manuscripts must be submitted electronically in <a href="https://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2022/icdm22/scripts/ws_submit.php?subarea=S">online submission system</a>. <b>We do not accept email submissions.</b></p>

            <p><b>Note that all accepted papers will be included in the IEEE ICDM 2022 Workshops Proceedings volume published by IEEE Computer Society Press, and will also be included in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. ​​Therefore, papers must not have been accepted for publication elsewhere or be under review for another workshop, conferences or journals.</b></p>
