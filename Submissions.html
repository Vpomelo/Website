            <p>
                Authors are invited to submit original papers that must not have been submitted to or published in any other workshop, conference, or journal. The workshop will accept full papers describing completed work, work-in-progress papers with preliminary results, as well as position papers reporting inspiring and intriguing new ideas. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Paper submissions should be limited to max 8 pages plus 2 extra pages, including the bibliography and any possible appendices. Full paper submissions should be formatted according to the IEEE 2-column format(<a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">link</a>).
                Submissions longer than 10 pages will be rejected without review. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by members of the Program Committee and be evaluated for originality, quality and appropriateness to the workshop.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the unique ICDM tradition, all accepted workshop papers will be published in the dedicated ICDMW proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press.
                At least one author of each accepted paper must complete the ICDM 2022 conference registration and present the paper at the workshop.
