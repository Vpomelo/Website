        <li><b>Submission Guidelines</b></li>
        <p>Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages, in the IEEE 2-column format (<a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">link</a>), including the bibliography and any possible appendices. Submissions longer than 10 pages will be rejected without review. All submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to scope of the conference, originality, significance, and clarity. The following sections give further information for authors. Please refer to the ICDM regular submission requirment for more information:<a href="http://icdm2018.org/calls/call-for-papers/">http://icdm2018.org/calls/call-for-papers/</a>  </p>
        <li><b>How to prepare your submissions</b></li>
        <p>The authors shall omit their names from the submission. For formatting templates with author and institution information, simply replace all these information in the template by “Anonymous”.</p>
        <p>In the submission, the authors’ should refer to their own prior work like the prior work of any other author, and include all relevant citations. This can be done either by referring to their prior work in the third person or referencing papers generically. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on clustering, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on distance-based clustering (Smith 2005),”  you might say “We extend Smith’s (Smith 2005) earlier work on distance-based clustering.”</p>
          <p>The authors shall exclude citations to their own work which is not fundamental to understanding the paper, including prior versions (e.g., technical reports, unpublished internal documents) of the submitted paper. They should reference only necessary work using point (2). Hence, do not write: “In our previous work [3]” as it reveals that citation 3 is written by the current authors.</p>
          <p>The authors shall remove mention of funding sources, personal acknowledgments, and other such auxiliary information that could be related to their identities. These can be reinstituted in the camera-ready copy once the paper is accepted for publication.</p>
          <p>The authors shall make statements on well-known or unique systems that identify an author, as vague in respect to identifying the authors as possible.</p>
          <p>The submitted files shall be named with care to ensure that authors’ anonymity is not compromised by the file name. For example, do not name your submission “Smith.pdf”, instead give it a name that is descriptive of the title of your paper, such as “ANewApproachtoClustering.pdf” (or a shorter version of the same).</p>
          <p>Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings by the IEEE Computer SocietyPress.</p>

        <li><b>Online Submission System</b></li>
        <p>All manuscripts are submitted as full papers and are reviewed based on their scientific merit. The reviewing process is confidential. There is no separate abstract submission step. There are no separate industrial, application, short paper or poster tracks. Manuscripts must be submitted electronically in <a href="https://www.wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2018/icdm18/scripts/submit.php?subarea=S05">online submission system</a>. <b>We do not accept email submissions.</b></p>

        <p><b>Note that all accepted papers will be included in the IEEE ICDM 2018 Workshops Proceedings volume published by IEEE Computer Society Press, and will also be included in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. ​​Therefore, papers must not have been accepted for publication elsewhere or be under review for another workshop, conferences or journals.</b></p>
